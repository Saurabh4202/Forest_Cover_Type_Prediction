# Forest Cover Prediction

## Description
This project aims to predict seven different cover types in four different wilderness areas of the Roosevelt National Forest of Northern Colorado. The dataset includes various environmental features such as elevation, aspect, slope, and soil types, among others.

## Tasks
- Task 1: Complete data analysis report on the given data.
- Task 2: Create a predictive model to accurately predict forest cover types.

## Dataset
The dataset can be found [here](https://d3ilbtxij3aepc.cloudfront.net/projects/CDS-Capstone-Projects/PRCP-1005-ForestCoverPred.zip). It includes the following fields:
- Elevation
- Aspect
- Slope
- Horizontal_Distance_To_Hydrology
- Vertical_Distance_To_Hydrology
- Horizontal_Distance_To_Roadways
- Hillshade_9am, Hillshade_Noon, Hillshade_3pm
- Horizontal_Distance_To_Fire_Points
- Wilderness_Area (4 binary columns)
- Soil_Type (40 binary columns)
- Cover_Type (7 types)

## Wilderness Areas
1. Rawah Wilderness Area
2. Neota Wilderness Area
3. Comanche Peak Wilderness Area
4. Cache la Poudre Wilderness Area

## Soil Types
[Description of soil types]

## Tasks
### Task 1: Data Analysis Report
